You should be using [Troll Engine](https://github.com/riconuts/FNF-Troll-Engine) if you want to keep using my work (i.e for modcharting), or you should be using something like [Maru Funkin'](https://github.com/MaybeMaru/Maru-Funkin) if you are averse to using a Psych-derived project.

# Friday Night Funkin: Andromeda Engine

"ANDROMEDA ENGINE IS GOATED" - bbpanzu

Andromeda Engine is a fork of Friday Night Funkin' with customization and gameplay in mind.

Andromeda Engine includes but is not limited to:
- Customizable note skins
- Better input
- A modifier system based on NotITG's and Schmovin's (Schmovin' concept by [4mbr0s3 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCez-Erpr0oqmC71vnDrM9yA))
- A whole lotta options
- The ability to add characters without recompiling source (Press 8 ingame to open the character editor) (Support for Psych's character format, too!)
- The ability to add songs to freeplay without recompiling source
- One of the best lua modchart systems in FNF so far (probably (in my opinion, anyway (I haven't used Psych's)))
- Scroll velocities/mid-song speed changes

## Build instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR COMPILING THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE!!!

IF YOU WANT TO JUST DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL AND PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY, GO TO ITCH.IO TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME FOR PC, MAC, AND LINUX!!

https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin

IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE THE GAME YOURSELF, CONTINUE READING!!!

### Installing the Required Programs

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple).
1. [Install Haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
newgrounds
```
So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install newgrounds`

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.

Then for each of these type `haxelib git [libraryname] [library]` so `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git`
```
polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git
discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
hxvm-luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/hxvm-luajit
linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit
```

Alternatively, you can run "dependencies.bat" (on Windows) to install every dependency


You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

### Compiling game

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run `lime test html5 -debug` in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: [https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))
To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug` and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.

If you get an error about StatePointer, you'll want to run these:
```
haxelib remove linc_luajit
haxelib remove hxvm-luajit
```

And then

```
haxelib git hxvm-luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/hxvm-luajit
haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit
```

(Thanks KadeDev for figuring this out because I was stuck on why it happened tbh)
